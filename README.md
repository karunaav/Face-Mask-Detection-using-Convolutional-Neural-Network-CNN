Face Mask Detection using CNN
A deep learning project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask.
Overview
This project implements a CNN model to classify images into two categories:

With Mask - Person wearing a face mask
Without Mask - Person not wearing a face mask

Requirements
bashpip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib
Usage
Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter and run the cells sequentially to train the model and make predictions.
Model Architecture

Convolutional layers for feature extraction
Pooling layers for dimensionality reduction
Dense layers for classification
Dropout for regularization

Results
The model achieves high accuracy on detecting faces with and without masks.
